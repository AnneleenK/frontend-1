# es6 & beyond

## Chapter 1: ES? Now & Future

### Introduction

It's time we dive into the evolution of JS to explore all the changes coming not only soon but farther over the horizon.

Unlike ES5, ES6 is not just a modest set of new APIs added to the language. It incorporates a whole slew of new syntactic forms, some of which may take quite a bit of getting used to. There's also a variety of new organization forms and new API helpers for various data types.

ES6 is a radical jump forward for the language. Even if you think you know JS in ES5, ES6 is full of new stuff you don't know yet, so get ready! This book explores all the major themes of ES6 that you need to get up to speed on, and even gives you a glimpse of future features coming down the track that you should be aware of.

Warning: All code in this book assumes an ES6+ environment. At the time of this writing, ES6 support varies quite a bit in browsers and JS environments

### Versioning

The JavaScript standard is referred to officially as "ECMAScript" - ES. "5" for "5th edition".

The earliest versions, ES1 and ES2, were not widely known or implemented. 
ES3 was the first widespread baseline for JavaScript
For political reasons beyond what we'll cover here, the ill-fated ES4 never came about.
In 2009, ES5 was officially finalized (later ES5.1 in 2011), and and explosion of browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, and many others.
Leading up to the expected next version of JS (slipped from 2013 to 2014 and then 2015), the obvious and common label in discourse has been ES6.

suggestions have surfaced that versioning may in the future switch to a year-based schema, such as ES2016
It's also valid to consider the future of JS versioning to be per-feature rather than per-arbitrary-collection-of-major-features (as it is now) or even per-year (as it may become).
The takeaway is that the version labels stop being as important, and JavaScript starts to be seen more as an evergreen, living standard.

### Transpiling

A problem arises for JS developers who at once may both strongly desire to use new features while at the same time being slapped with the reality that their sites/apps may need to support older browsers without such support.
many are just recently (at the time of this writing) starting to adopt things like ``` strict ``` mode, which landed in ES5 over five years ago.
So how do we resolve this seeming contradiction? The answer is tooling, specifically a technique called transpiling (transformation + compiling)
Transpilers perform transformations for you, usually in a build workflow step similar to how you perform linting, minification, and other similar operations.
