# Best practices
* Avoid polluting the global scope  
Don't declare global variables if you don't need them to be global. Because they will be stored in the window object where there is a lot going on already. 
* Use strict equal  
If you use ``` == ``` a string and a number will be equal. Use strict equal ``` === ``` to check the type.
* Use ``` && ``` and ``` || ```  
You can make your code shorter using these logic operators.
* Convert values' types
